For those who want to reproduce this project:
This project was compiled and run under Coursera lab envrionment. I was not able to use git to submit the project into my github repository due to the VS Code version of Coursera is to old to support github authentication policy.

To reproduce this, please follow below steps:
1. Open the Coursera Course Independent project Lab.
2. Clone the Nvidia NPP sample to local:
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
3. copy the cudnn_logestic directory of this project to the same level as Common of the cuda-sample repository.
4. make clean build
